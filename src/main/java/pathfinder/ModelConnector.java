In the pathfinder homework, the text user interface calls these methods to talk
to your model. In the campuspaths homework, your graphical user interface
will ultimately make class to these methods (through a web server) to
talk to your model the same way.

This is the power of the Model-View-Controller pattern, two completely different
user interfaces can use the same model to display and interact with data in
different ways, without requiring a lot of work to change things over.
