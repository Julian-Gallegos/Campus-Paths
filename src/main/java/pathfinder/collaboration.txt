Ziggie Rai:
More one way this time with discussion. Ziggie asked me some questions about generics but I don't remember the details,
also asked me some questions about CampusPath and CampusBuilding,
such as "are all the coordinates for buildings represented in the set of CampusPaths?" I said "I think so," so in
retrospect I probably was not that helpful.
