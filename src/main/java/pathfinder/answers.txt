Changed MarvelPaths' main to properly account for searching characters that do no exist in the graph, previously threw
a null pointer exception.
Did the same in the MarvelTestDriver's findPath method.

Some small code cleanup throughout Graph and Node, but nothing changing implementation functionality or specifications.
