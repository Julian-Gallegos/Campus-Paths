# Tests that edgeExists properly returns true if the edge exists

#Create an empty graph
created graph graph1

# Add node to a graph
added node node1 to graph1
added node node2 to graph1

# Add an edge from node1 to node 2
added edge edge1 from node1 to node2 in graph1

# See if edge1 exists
edge1 from node1 to node 2 in graph1 exists (true)
