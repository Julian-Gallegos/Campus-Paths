# Tests that the list of out edges from a node can be printed out

#Create an empty graph
created graph graph1

# Add node to a graph
added node node1 to graph1
added node node2 to graph1

# Add edges from node1 to node 2
added edge edge1 from node1 to node2 in graph1
added edge edge2 from node1 to node2 in graph1

# Print the out edges from node1 to node 2
the edges from node1 to node 2 in graph1 are: edge1, edge2
