# Tests that the list of children for a parent node can be printed out

# Create an empty graph
created graph graph1

# Add nodes to a graph
added node node1 to graph1
added node node2 to graph1
added node node3 to graph1

# Add edges
added edge edge1 from node1 to node2 in graph1
added edge edge2 from node1 to node2 in graph1
added edge edge1 from node1 to node3 in graph1
added edge aaaaa from node1 to node3 in graph1

# Print all of the children of a node
the children of node1 in graph1 are: node2(edge1) node2(edge2) node3(aaaaa) node3(edge1)
