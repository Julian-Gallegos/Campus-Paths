# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# there are multiple edges from A to B
# Want to use lowest cost node

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph

added edge 11.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 10.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 5.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 112.000 from A to B in simpleGraph

path from A to B:
A to B with weight 5.000
total cost: 5.000
