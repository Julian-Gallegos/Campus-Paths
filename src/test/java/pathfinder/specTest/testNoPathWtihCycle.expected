# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# there is a cycle of nodes in the graph and
# there is no path from starting node to destination node

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph
added node D to simpleGraph

added edge 0.000 from A to C in simpleGraph
added edge 0.000 from C to D in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from D to A in simpleGraph

path from A to B:
no path found
